# What is API Documentation

API (Application Programming Interface) consists of a set of protocols to communicate between software applications. These APIs are generally developed/build by software developers based on the requirement to share information in a secure manner. These APIs can be written in any languages such as C++, Java, Python, PHP, JavaScript, etc.,

Examples of API in real time;

1. When paying online for a purchase,  the relevant API takes you to the exact payment gateway i a secure manner.
2. When you check for weather updates in Google, it will display the data with the help of the weather API.
3. When you look for specific shops, doctor offices online, specific data is retrieved in few seconds with the help of the API.

You give a query, the API carries the query as a request, hits the web server for the information and retrieves the data as responses. So API acts as a interface between the client and server.

Like any other software that has a user manual to decipher it's functionalities, API also needs to be documented in a way that is understandable to everyone. Also, documenting API can be helping for the developers who would be look into it for a future use. So that's where API documentation pitches in. These documentations are developed by technical writers who get to interact with the developers get a mutual understanding of the API. After getting the info, writers come up with a API documentation explaining each and every part/elements of the API.

So the process goes like, new requirements--> Developer Builds API --> Writers/Developers discussion --> Writers develop API Documentation

The most common API is Rest API as I is language agnostic and follows stateless protocol.
